# StaticAuth

This repository is a proof of concept demonstrating how a static webpage hosted on the students sites can be used in conjunction with an external server to retrieve student data.

Code and information about the backend can be found in the [API](https://github.com/QuietRocket/StaticAuth/tree/master/api) directory.

Static frontend files can be found in the [public](https://github.com/QuietRocket/StaticAuth/tree/master/public) directory.
